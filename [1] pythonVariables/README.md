# Python Variables

In Python, **variables** act as containers for storing data values. Unlike many other languages, Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning you don't need to declare a variable's type before using it; the type is determined automatically based on the value assigned.

### Key Features
* **Declaration:** Created the moment you assign a value using the `=` operator (e.g., `name = "Bro"`).
* **Dynamic Typing:** You can reassign a variable to a different data type at any time.
* **Case Sensitivity:** `Age`, `age`, and `AGE` are treated as three distinct variables.
* **Naming Conventions:** Must start with a letter or underscore, cannot start with a number, and are typically written in `snake_case`.
